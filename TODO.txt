check each module (players, shop, inventory) before closing application
in question popup set focus on first button
form validation
payback (client doesn't want anymore an already paid article !! only for cash payment)
transaction edition
article DB (real DB instead of xml file)
replace ArticlesDb/PlayersDb singleton with IOC RegisterInstance (IArticlesDb + IPlayersDb)
PlayersDb: store the list of players (similar to ArticlesDb + call load from MainViewModel)
Players -> remove save button, save automatically once a modification has been done

new module: inventory

known issues:
after creating a new article, article cannot be added to shopping cart with enter

workaround to fix:
PlayerViewModel: Load must be called after Save to reset row.IsNewItem
