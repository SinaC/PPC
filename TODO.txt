check each module (players, shop, inventory) before closing application
article refund (client doesn't want anymore an already paid article !! only for cash payment)
transaction edition
article DB (real DB instead of xml file)
PlayersDb: store the list of players (similar to ArticlesDb + call load from MainViewModel)
Players -> remove save button, save automatically once a modification has been done

move popup logic in a new project depending on EasyMVVM (EasyPopup)

Discount: % or free article (not fixed amount anymore)

inventory:
!! after import -> every article guid are modified -> shopping carts and backup files are invalid

known issues:
after creating a new article, article cannot be added to shopping cart with enter
 ==> it seems KeyFriendlyAutoCompleteBox lose SelectedItem once entered is pressed

workaround to fix:
PlayerViewModel: Load must be called after Save to reset row.IsNewItem
