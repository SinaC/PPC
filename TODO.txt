store discount in transaction
cash registry closure banknotes/coins amount (new file with starting values)
check each module (players, shop, inventory) before closing application
form validation
payback (client doesn't want anymore an already paid article !! only for cash payment)
transaction edition
article DB (real DB instead of xml file)
replace ArticlesDb/PlayersDb singleton with IOC RegisterInstance (IArticlesDb + IPlayersDb)
PlayersDb: store the list of players (similar to ArticlesDb + call load from MainViewModel)
Players -> remove save button, save automatically once a modification has been done
add new method in IPopupService: DisplayError(string title, string message)

new mobile UI: 
article selection using big button displaying categories -> subcategories -> articles + back button (->ArticleSelectorView/ViewModel)
note more function buttons on left, unique button displaying panel with functions buttons

new module: inventory
!! after import -> every article guid are modified -> shopping carts and backup files are invalid

ArticleSelectorView/ViewModel: buttons to scroll up/down -> paged collection

known issues:
after creating a new article, article cannot be added to shopping cart with enter

workaround to fix:
PlayerViewModel: Load must be called after Save to reset row.IsNewItem
